How to make a new release
=========================
To prepare a new build we don't have right now a build system to pack everything together, so just use the default eclipse system.

The way to use it is:
 1.- Go to Eclispe
 2.- Select the project and left click on it.
 3.- Go to the export option and select "Runnable JAR File". 
 4.- Then select the default options and use a Run configuration which is used to execute current client.
 5.- Then try to export it with the default options, and you have a .jar file which can be executed with:
 	java -jar <filename>.jar 
 	Where <filename>.jar is the name of the jar file you have generated.
