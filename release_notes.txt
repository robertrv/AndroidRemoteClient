Relase Notes
============
1.0 
---
First release of the software comming from http://code.google.com/p/androidremote-client/
2.0 
---
 * Refactor to add a exception manager (which I think is not properly working)
 * Added Reboot operation and manage the case of location not properly setted (normally happens on device)
2.1
---
 * Refactor of the current library to connect through VNC, using the new 
 tightvnc version (2.0.4) as a library, not directly the code. Still needed to
  copy one class of code, named ARViewer but clearly identified where the 
  changes are so we can easily upgrade to a new release.
  
  2.1
---
 * New tight vnc version (2.1).
